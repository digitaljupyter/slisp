SalmonLisp is a part of the Lisp family (*obviously adopted*), Salmon has been designed to be easy & lightweight, and it also reinvents the wheel by adding features from [almost every one of my programming languages. And some other ones too.](./Standard/index.md)

SLisp is technically it's own language, but can be used as a powerful interpreter for other lisp dialects, if supported.

The nature of Salmon is like Python, it's high-level and is built with a language that has built-in memory safety & type safety.

Salmon isn't only good for heavy Lisp algorithms, abiding SLisp's dynamic nature, it can be used to create
anything from basic scripts!.
