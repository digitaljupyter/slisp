# The File Extension Dilemma

There are multiple options for a file extension, you could use either the `.asd` file extension, or the custom `.sal` file extension.

## Why `.asd`?

The reason we adopted the `.asd` file extension is because we wanted something compatible with Common Lisp, without it being Common Lisp exactly. So we sought that `.asd` was the most CL-non-CL it could be.
